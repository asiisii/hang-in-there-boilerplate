## About
This is the first paired project we did it for Turing. We were given html and css file. Our task was to create a random poster generator with pre-assigned data for the posters. You can also input your own data to generate your own unique poster by click one “Make Your Own Poster” button. Until you make your favorite/unique poster or by using the “Show Another Random Poster” button
You can save your favorite poster by clicking on the “Save This Poster” button and view the saved posters by clicking on the “Show Saved Posters”
